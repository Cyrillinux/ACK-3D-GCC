********************************************************************

ACK-3D GCC is a modern implementation of Lary L. Myers' "Animation 
Construction Kit" from his book "Amazing 3-D Games Adventure Set" 
(Coriolis Group, 1995, ISBN 1-883577-15-2). It's designed to be 
built with Code::Blocks and the GNU GCC compiler. It is a platform-
independent engine, so it should compile and run on virtually 
anything. By default, it'll compile to liback.a for use in other
programs. This code is currently undocumented, except in Lary's 
book.

Lary Myers originally released this as an open-source engine in 
1993. I couldn't find any copyright details, so I decided it would
be best to release this under the zlib/libpng license; see the 
COPYING file for details. If you know how I can reach Lary, please 
let me know so I can work out something with his full consent.

Thanks, and enjoy!
